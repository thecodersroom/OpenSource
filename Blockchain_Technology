The Rise of Blockchain Technology
----------------------------------
Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that securely records transactions across multiple computers, ensuring transparency, security, and immutability. Originally developed to support cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain has expanded into other areas, including finance, supply chain, and healthcare, due to its ability to prevent tampering and enable trustless transactions. By allowing peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries, blockchain promises to streamline operations, reduce costs, and increase transparency in various sectors. As blockchain adoption grows, it holds the potential to redefine how we manage data, assets, and digital identities.
