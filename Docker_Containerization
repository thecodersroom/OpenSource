An Overview of Docker and Containerization
----------------------------------------------
Docker is a powerful platform for developing, shipping, and running applications using containerization. Containers package an application along with its dependencies, libraries, and configurations, making it portable and consistent across different environments. Unlike virtual machines, containers are lightweight and allow multiple applications to run on the same system without conflict. Docker simplifies deployment, enhances scalability, and improves resource efficiency, making it ideal for both development and production environments. As containerization becomes a standard in DevOps and cloud environments, understanding Docker is an essential skill for modern developers.
